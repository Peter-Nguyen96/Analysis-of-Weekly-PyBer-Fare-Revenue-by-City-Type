An analysis of Weekly PyBer Fare Revenue by City Type

Overview: An investigation was conducted on the revenue trends of PyBer in 2019.  The weekly revenue generated by ride fares was analyzed across urban, suburban, and rural city types in the operating region.  This was done in order to determine general trends in the data as well as to determine if there are any potential inefficiencies in the business model that may need to be altered to increase profitability.

Data Analysis results: The analysis performed on raw PyBer ride data and city data determined the total number of rides for each city type, the total number of drivers working in each city type, the total revenue generated by fares, the average fare per ride and the averaged fare per driver. The analysis also visualized the revenue generated by fares in the first 4 months of 2019 by PyBer.

Summary Data: To generate the summary data for PyBer in 2019, the city dataframes and ride dataframes were merged by city into a complete dataset (fig 1). This dataset contained all rides data and also contained the city type.  The number of rides, drivers, and the fare was summed for each city type, and the mean fare per ride and fare per driver was deterined and assembled into a new dataframe (fig 2).

The summary data shows that more densely populated urban urban environments generate the most revenue by fares ($39,854.38), and had the most number of rides and total drivers while sparsley populated rural cities generated less revenue and had fewer riders and drivers.  This suggests that the utilization rate of PyBer occurs most in densely populated cities.  However utilization per capita has not been determined due to a lack of population data.  In lieu of per capita utilization data, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver may produce a similar amount of insight.  The average fare per ride and fare per driver are inversely proportionate to population density, showing higher monotary rates in rural cities.  This may suggest that demand in rural areas may be higher on a per capita basis than urban cities, and the increase in fare cost likely attributes to either a short supply of drivers, or longer distances to destinations.  Looking at the total rides and total drivers, indicates that a short supply of drivers may be contributing to higher fare costs since the ratio of rides to drivers in rural cities is nearly 2:1 while urban cities have a nearly 1:2 ratio of rides to drivers indicating an excess supply of drivers.

Total Fare Weekly Revenue by City Type: The weekly trend in revenue generated by fare data was ploted using the ride date data from the complete dataset.  Dates were binned into weeks, and the total revenue in each city type was summer for each week.  The first 4 months of 2019 were plotted for analysis (fig 3).

Utilization of PyBer in the first 4 months does not indicates that on average time of year affects utilization of PyBer.  Each city type saw relatively uniform utilzation across the first 4 months of 2019 indicating that there is not an increase or decrease in demand from regular users in any particular city type.  A slight increase in revenue was observed in the month of January leading up to February, coming out of winter months, which may sugest the platform gained traction from regular commuters to work.  Urban cities saw the longest trend increase extending into Feburary.  A spike across all city types was observed in the last week of February, which aside from National Clam Chowder day does not coincide with any nationally observed holiday.  However late February 2019 does align with a greater than historical amount of rainfall and flooding which suggests that PyBer may have seen higher utilization during inclimate weather events due to local flooding. Other rapid changes in utilization across the three city types are not correlated with each other, and may represent local events.

Conclusion:  

Based on the analysis, several business inefficiencies have been identified as candidates for restructuring.  Rural cities are in short supply of drivers, and have the least utilization.  As a fairly unpenetrated market with unmet demand, a business strategy to incentivise new drivers in rural cities may increase revenue.  Conversely, urban cities contain an excess of drivers, and thus have a lower cost per fare.  A business strategy to incentivise new riders in urban cities to generate more demand may further increase revenues despite being the highest earning city type.  Promotional campaigns to incentivise new clients in urban cities is advised.  Finally, an increase in utilization is not observed in relationt to time indicating that no new users are joining PyBer.  An increase in advertisement and awareness may be necessary to increase user base and generate a healthy increasing utilization curve over time, especially near major holidays to capitalize on inebreated individuals.
